## Advanced Configuration

To simultaneously enable multiple identity verification sources, please set the `NEXT_AUTH_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable, separating them with commas, for example, `auth0,azure-ad,authentik`.

The order corresponds to the display order of the SSO providers.

| SSO Provider       | Value       |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Auth0              | `auth0`     |
| Microsoft Entra ID | `azure-ad`  |
| Authentik          | `authentik` |
| Github             | `github`    |
| ZITADEL            | `zitadel`   |

## Other SSO Providers
